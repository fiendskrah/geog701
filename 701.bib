  abstract = {Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical cartography and visual communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial patterns, conceptualize proposed designs, compare alternatives, and engage the public. Classic urban form visualizations \textendash{} from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets \textendash{} have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.},

There are two ways Big Data are making a big impact: a reconceptualization of (geo)privacy, and ``algorithmic security.'' Geoprivacy is revealed as a geopolitical assemblage rather than something possessed and is part of emerging political economy of technology and neoliberal markets. Security has become increasingly algorithmic and biometric, enrolling Big Data to disambiguate the biopolitical subject. Geoweb and remote sensing technologies, companies, and knowledges are imbricated in this assemblage of algorithmic security. I conclude with three spaces of intervention; new critical histories of the geoweb that trace the relationship of geography and the state; a fuller political economy of the geoweb and its circulations of geographical knowledge; and legislative and encryption efforts that enable the geographic community to participate in public debate.},

  abstract = {The discipline of geography encompasses both natural and social sciences and has the natural advantage of enabling the study of sustainability from a transdisciplinary perspective. There are great opportunities for geographers to participate in sustainability research. However, while geographers have set sustainability goals, they have rarely clarified the details for reaching those goals. Current knowledge on the relationship between humans and the environment and the methodologies for studying this relationship are inadequate to solve the transdisciplinary questions in sustainability science. Five research areas: geographical processes; ecosystem services and human wellbeing; human-environmental systems; sustainable development; and geo-data and modelling for sustainability are proposed as those needed to help geography achieve sustainability. The key objective of promoting geography for sustainability is to reveal the mechanisms of human-environmental system dynamics. This depends on understanding the processes in the natural and social systems and their mutual feedback as well as clarifying the relationships between the structures, functional characteristics and interactions in the human-environmental systems at multiple scales. The advancement of geography and its methodologies and technologies will provide a more profound understanding of the future. Geographers have the responsibility of promoting the discipline as the key pathway for carrying natural and social sciences towards sustainability.},

  abstract = {This article presents an empirical analysis of the postindustrial policing hypothesis, which argues that as cities pursue growth strategies designed to appeal to members of the so-called ?creative classes,? they increasingly adopt punitive policing strategies, such as order maintenance policing. While several studies offer some evidence for the hypothesis, no study has yet tested the most direct spatial implication of this hypothesis within cities: that areas of a city undergoing gentrification or revitalization will evince higher levels of postindustrial policing. In a series of spatial Durbin models that utilize newly available data sets from New York City, this article demonstrates a strong positive association between gentrification and postindustrial policing. The article also finds that citizen demand for postindustrial policing is only weakly associated with its spatial distribution. These results and their potential implications are discussed in the conclusion.},

Citing unsanitary conditions, Fresno officials implemented a policy of bulldozing the encampments while providing housing vouchers to a small number of residents. Yet homeless Fresnans by and large demanded the provision of sanitation in the encampments as an alternative to eviction. In doing so, they invoked their right to urban infrastructure. Drawing from literature on informal housing in the Global South, this paper argues that individual housing rights present a limited framework through which to understand homeless people's right to the city, and that a truly radical right to the city should reflect the demand for sanitation infrastructure emerging from the streets.},

This paper focuses on homeless women with children and argues that, in addition to the material deprivation of poverty, the sociospatial stigmatization of homeless women constitutes a primary obstacle to their reentry into mainstream, domiciled society. How does sociospatial stigma constrain homeless women with children as they navigate the transition between homeless and homed? How do these women deflect and circumvent the social and spatial boundaries defined by stigmatization? An analysis of semistructured interviews with eight women with children in Orange County, California, highlights the ways that the social identity of women as homeless is reinforced by social service agencies, potential employers, family, and friends, and illustrates how homeless women attempt to circumvent the negative attributes associated with homelessness.},

  abstract = {In recent years, much has been written on ?big data? in both the popular and academic press. After the hubristic declaration of the ?end of theory? more nuanced arguments have emerged, suggesting that increasingly pervasive data collection and quantification may have significant implications for the social sciences, even if the social, scientific, political, and economic agendas behind big data are less new than they are often portrayed. Compared to the boosterish tone of much of its press, academic critiques of big data have been relatively muted, often focusing on the continued importance of more traditional forms of domain knowledge and expertise. Indeed, many academic responses to big data enthusiastically celebrate the availability of new data sources and the potential for new insights and perspectives they may enable. Undermining many of these critiques is a lack of attention to the role of technology in society, particularly with respect to the labor process, the continued extension of labor relations into previously private times and places, and the commoditization of more and more aspects of everyday life. In this article, we parse a variety of big data definitions to argue that it is only when individual datums by the million, billion, or more are linked together algorithmically that ?big data? emerges as a commodity. Such decisions do not occur in a vacuum but as part of an asymmetric power relationship in which individuals are dispossessed of the data they generate in their day-to-day lives. We argue that the asymmetry of this data capture process is a means of capitalist ?accumulation by dispossession? that colonizes and commodifies everyday life in ways previously impossible. Situating the promises of ?big data? within the utopian imaginaries of digital frontierism, we suggest processes of data colonialism are actually unfolding behind these utopic promises. Amid private corporate and academic excitement over new forms of data analysis and visualization, situating big data as a form of capitalist expropriation and dispossession stresses the urgent need for critical, theoretical understandings of data and society.},
